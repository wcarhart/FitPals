### Building the project
With the addition of CocoaPods, take the following steps to build the project:
1. Open `Terminal`
2. `cd` into your project's directory.
3. Run the following commands
```
sudo gem install cocoapods
pod setup
pod install
```
4. When the installation has completed, quit `Xcode`.
5. In Finder, open your project's directory. You should see two Xcode files, a blue one that ends in `.xcodeproj` and a white one that ends in `.xcworkspace`. Double click on the white `.xcworkspace` file to open the project (you'll have to use white icon from now on).
